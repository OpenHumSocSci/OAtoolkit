# Possible projects to flesh out the OH Toolkit

## Taxonomy for Open Humanities
* **[Version 0.0.1 here](https://github.com/OpenHumSocSci/OAtoolkit/blob/master/OHTaxonomy.md)**
* Adapt and expand [Martin Paul Eve’s Open Access Glossary](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/open-access-and-the-humanities/glossary-of-open-access-terms/6E0F41EB7B359E91A17137E91F97B401).
* Perhaps some terms the [open research glossary](https://figshare.com/articles/Open_Research_Glossary/1482094)
* Utilize [this tool](http://vocabularyserver.com/) to share/translate in language and cultural contexts

## Create a “10 Things a Humanist should know about Scholarly Communication” guide
* Based on [10 Things You Should Know About Scholarly Communication](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1048&context=scholcom)

## Sketch a Rainbow of Open Humanities Practices
* Adapted from the [Rainbow of Open Science Practices](https://zenodo.org/record/1147025#.W2HYSdhKiRc)

## Draft a workflow for open humanities 
* From undergrad research, through masters thesis, to graduate teaching assignment, to archival research, to dissertation, to journal article(s), to book chapter, to monograph, etc. etc.
* Is it possible to introduce open at each point of this spectrum?
