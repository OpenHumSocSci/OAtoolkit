# Open Humanities and Social Science Toolkit

_"Open Humanities and Social Sciences are as well represented in open conversations as other fields, and face unique challenges. In this repo, and into the future, we're aiming to start building connections between those of us working on all kinds of open issue in Humanities and Social Sciences in order to build momentum and move forward."_

A small group at OpenCon last year broke off during the do-a-thon to explore the idea of what open humanities and social sciences looked like. One outcome was the concept of an “Open humanities toolkit” which would provide easy first step for someone from a humanities background to get a high-level overview of the top issues, challenges, opportunities, and resources for making humanities-based scholarship and practices more open.

* This concept was born at [OpenCon 2017 in Berlin](https://github.com/sparcopen/doathon/issues/56)
* The idea was continued at the [FORCE11 Scholarly Communication Institute in San Diego](https://www.force11.org/fsci/2018/course-abstracts#MTWT6) (focused specifically on humanities)
* Where will you take this project next?!
